## Installation

It is recommended to install the plugin directly from within the client, so that it gets automatically updated.
In you TeamSpeak client, go to Tools->Options->Addons->Browse, search for the "Ducker" plugin and install.

## Compiling yourself
After cloning, you'll have to manually initialize the submodules:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Qt in the minor version of the client is required, e.g.

```
mkdir build32 & pushd build32
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A Win32 -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="path_to/Qt/5.12.3/msvc2017" ..
popd
mkdir build64 & pushd build64
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="path_to/Qt/5.12.3/msvc2017_64" ..
```
